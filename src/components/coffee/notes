useEffect(() => {
      if (searchTerms !== "") 
      {
        const subset = coffee.filter(coffee => coffee.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerms.toLowerCase()))
        setFiltered(subset)
      }
      else if(searchTerms !== "")
      {
          const secondSubset = coffee.filter(coffee => coffee.brand.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerms.toLowerCase()))
          setFiltered(secondSubset)
      }
      else 
      {
        setFiltered(coffee)
      }
    }, [searchTerms, coffee])

    how do i make the search bar work for several different things not just name such as brand, actor? im trying to set up conditionals. i prefer this over dropdown but not oppossed to learning how to do that either.

    work on quiz, what components would i need, i worked on a quiz form,
